# MSI Z370-A Pro OpenCore
```
- This is an archive of my OpenCore 0.8.0 configuration from mid 2022 for my old MSI Z370 system. 

- This is not a drop-in replacement, and I do not recommend using it as-is.

- This config should only be used to help with troubleshooting, or help you get off the ground.

Here is a list of hardware for which this config was made.<br/>

Board: MSI Z370-A Pro<br/>
Graphics: Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX 580 4GB<br/>
Processor: Intel Core i5-8400<br/>
Drive: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 500GB NVMe drive<br/>
Memory: shouldn't matter much<br/>

This config wasn't used with macOS newer than 10.15 Catalina, so compatibility with macOS 11.0+ is unknown.<br/>
This config skips the boot picker and has hotkey polling enabled.
